                    project. I wanted to get in some practice with CSS grid, as
                    well as implement some common modern website features like
                    full-width video and sticky headers.

                        For the products section of the website, I implemented
                        CSS grid for a truly dynamic layout that didn't require
                        a lot of styling.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my hobbies is bullet journaling, which is a
                    personalized system for organizing tasks. A common style of
                    bullet journaling includes adding handlettering, drawings,
                    and photos to the standard task lists and notetaking. Over
                    the course of 2019, I collected dozens of photographs on
                    Pinterest each month to add to my journal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the end of the year, I still had the Pinterest boards
                    that I had made. I wanted a way to display them that would
                    create a yearbook-esque viewing experience so that others
                    could see what had inspired me as I prepared my journal over
                    the year. I was determined to implement some of the React
                    skills I had learned to make an interesting art piece from
                    the preparations of a different art.

                    <figcaption>
                        I wanted each month to have a "scrapbook" sort of
                        feeling, so I played around with randomizing the layout
                        of the photos. I still want to figure out a way to get
                        them to fade in one at a time.

                <p>
                    The web application is made with React, with a small dose of
                    Redux thrown in. My original plan was to directly pull from
                    the Pinterest API to get the photos, but the limitations on
                    how often the data could be retrieved made me turn to Amazon
                    Firebase to store the photos from the Pinterest collections,
                    and retrieve from that personal database instead.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was a cumulation of several questions: what if
                    you could use a traditional crafting mechanism as a video
                    game controller? What if you had a choose-your-own-adventure
                    game that dynamically responded to the players choices? And
                    what if you could tell what choices a player had made after
                    they had completed the gameplay?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loominary was the result of these questions: a
                    choose-your-own-adventure digital game, controlled by a
                    handheld loom, with a resulting scarf at the end of
                    gameplay. The game was showcased at the 2017 Smithsonian
                    American Art Museum Arcade and went on to several other
                    conferences.

                        An interesting piece of this project was teaching users
                        how to weave. This screen from the game was an
                        experiment to see how we could get users to recognize
                        the link between the colors of the options and the yarn
                        that they had available to weave with.

                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    Creating the game required both hardware and software. The
                    game itself was created in the Twine game engine, which
                    boiled down to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing for
                    dynamic gameplay. The loom controller was made using RFID
                    tags and a sensor, which connected to its own application
                    running on a Raspberry Pi. This application sent the data to
                    a local server that hosted the compiled HTML Twine game.
