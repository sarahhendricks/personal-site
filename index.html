                <p>
                    I'm Sarah Hendricks: creative digital storyteller, coder,
                    and UX designer!

                <h2>A Bit About Me...</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a wearer of many hats: engineer, designer, writer, and
                    Scrum Master.
                </p>
                <h2>Current Projects</h2>
                <p>
                    This site! I wanted to finally dive deep into semantic HTML,
                    CSS3, and design.
                </p>

            <h2>The Fun Section!</h2>
            <p>AKA other hobbies that I have.</p>
            <h3>Figure skating</h3>
            <p>
                I started skating in January of 2019. I've made a lot of
                progress since then, especially with jumps, which are my
                favorite element! I hope to perform a program someday...
            </p>
            <h3>Animal Crossing</h3>
            <p>
                I've been playing versions of this game since it came out in
                2001. I got it for my 9th birthday, and I've treasured it ever
                since.
            </p>
            <h3>Reading (specifically cookbooks)</h3>
            <p>
                I love food so, so much! Cookbooks are very theraputic for me;
                they take me into a sensory world where everything smells,
                tastes, and looks amazing. A lifetime dream of mine is to eat my
                way across the world, in as many countries as possible!
            </p>
            <h3>Watercolors</h3>
            <p>
                Painting fascinated me as a kid, but I never invested the time
                to learn until the COVID-19 lockdown. Since then, I've been
                learning how to work with watercolors and to paint a variety of
                trees.
